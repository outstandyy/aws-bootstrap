# CodePipeline requires an S3 bucket to store artifacts built by CodeBuild.
#  We chose to create this bucket outside of our main CloudFormation template because
#  CloudFormation is unable to delete S3 buckets unless theyâ€™re empty.
#  This limitation becomes very inconvenient during development, because
#  you would have to delete the S3 bucket manually every time you tear down your CloudFormation stack.
# Therefore, we like to put resources such as these in a separate CloudFormation template called setup.yml.
